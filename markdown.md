# BMR, BMI,Body fat and TDEE Calculator

## Description

Calculator that calculates your BMR, Body fat percentage, body mass index and your total daily energy expenditure or TDEE.

**Basal metabolic rate (BMR)** is the average number of calories your body requires every day to fuel essential functions like breathing, pumping blood, producing hormones, and so forth (basically, it’s how many calories you’d burn resting for 24 hours). You can accurately estimate your BMR with your gender, weight, height, and age.

**Body fat percentage** is the percentage of your body weight that’s fat. A healthy body fat percentage for men is 8 to 17% body fat, and for women it’s 15 to 24%.

**Body mass index (BMI)** is a measure of your body weight per unit of height (calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared).

**Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)** is the average number of calories you burn per day. You can accurately estimate your TDEE with your weight, height, age, and activity level. Once you know your TDEE, you can use this number to determine how many calories you should eat every day to lose, gain, or maintain your weight.
